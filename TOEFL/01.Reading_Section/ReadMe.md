### Reading Section

The very first part of the TOEFL exam is the reading section. 
In the reading, you will find three academic passages(700 words), each followed 10 questions.
However, when you register for the TOEFL, you will be asked about
your field of study. Expect to have topics that are somewhat related to your major. Possible academic
topics include, architecture, biology, astronomy, physics, anthropology, American history, meteorology, etc.

- Reading 2100 words and answering 30 questions in 54 minutes is tough. You probably will
not have enough time to read the passage and then answer the questions. The questions are arranged in
the same order as the reading passage, so most TOEFL takers read and answer questions at the same
time. For example, if question two is in paragraph two, 95% of the time you can find the answer to
question three later in the same paragraph or in the next paragraph, paragraph three. The answer for
question three would not be in paragraph one because that would put it out of sequential order. In other
words, each question is placed in relation to where the answer is in the reading.
