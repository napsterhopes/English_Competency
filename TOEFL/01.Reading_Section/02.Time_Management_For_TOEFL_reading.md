- Question numbes
- Eliminated options
- Confusing questions - circle

We need above trick because the way question appear on the screen (one at a time. It is important to keep track of what u did in that question.

#### 2. Watch the clock
This can be too much to remember and keep track of:

but we can easily keep track that since we have to do `30` questions in `54` minutes, we basically need to do `10` questions/1 passage every `18` minutes:

If we can do before,it's always good as it will save us sometime for revision.

#### 3. Do not skip a question

Questions go in an order of the text:
Question number one is in paragraph one.
Question number two is in paragraph one or two.
Question number three is after that.

When you let's say skip question number two and then go back at the end, it's going to be hard for you to remember the passage.
You're going to have to read a lot more.
So instead, what you want to do is you want to make sure that you answer every single question.
And if you have doubt on that,circle it, don't skip it.

This is how you're going to keep track of the questions that you're not sure about and you want to go back.

#### 4. Review your answers

Use the `review` button at the end of the passage.
