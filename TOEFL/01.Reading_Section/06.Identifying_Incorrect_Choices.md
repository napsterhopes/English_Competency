`they varied significantly in size and weight` - This is paraphrasing.The answer has to be a little difficult so this choice cannot be the answer.

#### 2. Includes verbs like `all`/`always`,`never`
Another way you can see if a choice is incorrect is if it has adverbs like `all`,`always`, and `never`. 
In academic writing, there are things that are true but they're not always a hundred percent true or 100% false.
It's pretty rare to see words like `all`,`always`, and `never`.
That's one of identifying a wrong choice. Consider example paragraph:

#### 3. Contains the wrong modifier e.g 
What is a modifier?
Words which occur in such sentences which are about 80% same. 
Consider below example, where only changing words are `tremendous` , `some` , `almost`.

> Significance modifier

- This event has a **tremendous** effect
- This event has **some** impact
- This event has **almost** no impact

Above 3 sentences are 80% same but only differed by Significance modifier. 

> Time modifiers
Usually occur in history questions.

- almost two decades ago =~ 18-19 yrs ago
- in the early 18th century =~ 1700 to 1725
- the late 1900s =~  1980 to 1999

Be careful of such and can be used to pick incorrect choice.

#### 4. Mixed details
In the options below , example A says `More fossils of ceratopsians have been found than scientists expected`.
In the para,they never say "scientists expected" part, but they do say that they found a lot of fossils.

So we have to be careful a bit, they use some information that's true, but they mix the details around a bit to make a statement that's not true.
That's another way that they make an incorrect choice.

#### 5. Displays never mentioned info
Option C is not mentioned in para
