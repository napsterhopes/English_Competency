#### 1. Using the same words as the given text

`they varied significantly in size and weight` - This is paraphrasing.The answer has to be a little difficult so this choice cannot be the answer.

#### 2. Includes verbs like `all`/`always`,`never`
Another way you can see if a choice is incorrect is if it has adverbs like `all`,`always`, and `never`. 
In academic writing, there are things that are true but they're not always a hundred percent true or 100% false.
It's pretty rare to see words like `all`,`always`, and `never`.
That's one of identifying a wrong choice. Consider example paragraph:

#### 4. Contains the wrong modifier e.g 

> Significance modifier

- This event has a **tremendous** effect
- This event has **some** impact
- This event has **almost** no impact

Above 3 sentences are 80% same but only differed by Significance modifier. 

> Time modifiers

- almost two decades ago =~ 18-19 yrs ago
- in the early 18th century =~ 1700 to 1725
- the late 1900s =~  1980 to 1999
