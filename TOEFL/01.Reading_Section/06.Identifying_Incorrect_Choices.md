they varied significantly in size and weight, that's paraphrasing. I don't say

the same exact thing, right? They don't use the same words, because the question

has to be a little difficult, the answer has to be a little difficult. 

2. Includes verbs like `all`/`always`,`never`
3. Contains the wrong modifier e.g 

> Significance modifier

- This event has a **tremendous** effect
- This event has **some** impact
- This event has **almost** no impact

Above 3 sentences are 80% same but only differed by Significance modifier. 

> Time modifiers

- almost two decades ago =~ 18-19 yrs ago
- in the early 18th century =~ 1700 to 1725
- the late 1900s =~  1980 to 1999
