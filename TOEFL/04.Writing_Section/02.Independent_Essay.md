#### Template

> Introduction

Introduction doesn't have to be more than 3 sentences because you want most of your ideas and most of the information to come from the body paragraphs. 
Greyed part is the template.

> Body para

Body paragraph is is the longer one. 
You begin with first **reason**. 

`My personal experience is a great example of this`
Then transition to a personal example and then I connected back to the top again.
Writing personal experience helps us make paragraphs longer.

If you can't think of a personal example, you can also give it like an anecdote, which means like something you heard on the news,read in the newspaper, or something your friend told you. 
And that's what you want to do for almost every single body paragraph in your Independent writing. 

Then i move to `Conclusion`. What happened because of this story. I have to connect back to the `topic` which is here to stay healthy.

`As a result`, my mom lost 30 pounds.
`For this reason` , ... connecting back to topic.

Connect your example to topic.

Similarly for second para.

> Conclusion

- not more than 2 sentences
