#### Preparing your response

- Check your typing speed at keyhero.com.You should be able to type about 60 words per minute. Most places don't offer the paper-based test, so you have to do an internet-based test, the TOEFL iBT.
Go to keyhero.com, test your typing speed and see if it's something that you need to improve.

- Turn spellcheck off when you write your essay.On test day there is no spellcheck, there's no grammar check.
- Ask a teacher to review your writing
