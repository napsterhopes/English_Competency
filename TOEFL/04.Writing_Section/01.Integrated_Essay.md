### Integrated essay

In the Integrated essay, you have to read an academic text, listen to a lecture about the text, and then write an essay. 
- 3 min : The reading passage will introduce some topic e.g driverless cars, cars that can drive themselves.In the reading passage the author thinks driverless cars are a good thing and has three benefits of driverless cars.

- ~3 min: Listening passage will pose against it.It will say negative things about driverless cars.
- Reading passage will comeback.
- 20 minutes to write your essay

#### Preparing your response

- Check your typing speed at keyhero.com.You should be able to type about 60 words per minute. Most places don't offer the paper-based test, so you have to do an internet-based test, the TOEFL iBT.
Go to keyhero.com, test your typing speed and see if it's something that you need to improve.

- Turn spellcheck off when you write your essay.On test day there is no spellcheck, there's no grammar check.
- Ask a teacher to review your writing

- Stance is optional. Stance is where author stands on the topic
- Reading passage comes back when we start writing. But we should take notes there as well to expect what comes in `listening passage`.
For example,here is a `reading passage` on the left and notes from the `listening passage`.
Note that listening passage negates every +ve said on the reading passage.
- Taking notes in listening passage is really important because that can't be revisited.
