### Integrated essay

In the Integrated essay, you have to read an academic text, listen to a lecture about the text, and then write an essay. 
- 3 min : The reading passage will introduce some topic e.g driverless cars, cars that can drive themselves.In the reading passage the author thinks driverless cars are a good thing and has three benefits of driverless cars.

- ~3 min: Listening passage will pose against it.It will say negative things about driverless cars.
- Reading passage will comeback.
- 20 minutes to write your essay

#### Preparing your response

- Check your typing speed at keyhero.com.You should be able to type about 60 words per minute. Most places don't offer the paper-based test, so you have to do an internet-based test, the TOEFL iBT.
Go to keyhero.com, test your typing speed and see if it's something that you need to improve.

- Turn spellcheck off when you write your essay.On test day there is no spellcheck, there's no grammar check.
- Ask a teacher to review your writing

#### Question types to expect

1. Problem and Solutions
   - Turtle Excluder Devices
2. Speculations (Educated guess)
   - How the dinosaurs became extinct
3. Argument Style
   - Why self driving cars are safer

#### Taking notes

- Stance is optional. Stance is where author stands on the topic

> Listening passage will always be mirror image of the reading passage

- Reading passage comes back when we start writing. But we should take notes there as well to expect what comes in `listening passage`.
For example,here is a `reading passage` on the left and notes from the `listening passage`.
Note that listening passage negates every +ve said on the reading passage.
- Taking notes in listening passage is really important because that can't be revisited.

My notes represent the outline because the `introduction` is going to be the stance of the reading and the listening. 

- First body paragraph is going to be the first reason
- Second body paragraph is gonna be the second reason.

This will give an idea of what you're going to write in each paragraph. 

> Write your introduction (5 mins)

This is my introduction for Turtle Excluder Devices.

The parts highlighted in gray are part of the [template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RppMNF3Ts2dS5A1icXp_z8TSGSoUmnFJ/view?usp=share_link). 
These templates can be used in almost any Integrated writing question. 
Memorize these templates,test them out on your own, try them in different writing practice, and see how they work for you. They should work for almost any Integrated
writing. 

```
The article introduces the topic of <TOPIC_NAME>.
More specifically, the writer discusses <Writer's_stance_here>
The lecture in listening passage disagrees.She believes that <Stance> 
```

> Body paragraph (10 mins)

You should have 3 body paragraphs. 
I wrote 2-3 body paras.

We will use `Point by Point Method`, which is:
Go through each reason: reason 1, one paragraph, reason 2, second paragraph, reason 3, third body paragraph.

Let's go through the first body paragraph of how i wrote.

```
In the reading, the author begins by stating that ... so I start by talking about the reading passage and the first reason.
```

As a general rule of thumb, you should have 1 sentence about the reading passage and 2 sentences about the listening.
You should have more from the listening than from the reading. Because remember the reading passage you can actually see when you're writing, so the graders and the e-rater that automatically checks your writing, they are looking for vocabulary and details from the listening more than from the reading. 

Same things repeats in rest of the body paras.
Start with the reading, then transition to the listening

> Write a conclusion.
