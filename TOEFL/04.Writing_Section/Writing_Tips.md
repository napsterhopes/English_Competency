#### Adding Cohesion

Coherence is another criteria which is super important for both of your essays.
What is coherence?
Coherence is how well developed and how logical is your text.
Of course, you remember from the reading section, the logic of the English text is very important.
We always have the topic sentences at the beginning of the paragraphs and we have a thesis statement at the end of the introduction.

This coherence of an English text was very convenient for us in the reading section.
Now we also need to implement coherence in our writing.

So let's have a look at the coherence of the English text and revise this knowledge for ourselves.
This way we can always write coherently and then get very good scores for our writings.

> Basic structure of an English text

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12064832/207578820-ee98c8f7-be62-4c6f-962c-a91ea0a02132.png" width=500 />

- We start every text with an introduction, and the introduction usually has some sentences which are not that important.
And then it has a very important sentence, which is going to be the last sentence of the introduction, which is a **thesis** statement.
- First sentence of each paragraph is the most important sentence of this paragraph.It has two goals:

1. Goal 1 : It supports the thesis
2. Goal 2 : It integrates everything that will be said later in the paragraph.

So it unites all the ideas, all the details, all the examples which are going to happen here in this

paragraph.

It's kind of a title, the main idea of the paragraph.

So let's have a look at this FAQ paragraph.

This is the first sentence of the first paragraph, which no one supports the thesis, and two integrates

everything that will be said later in the paragraph.

This is a second sentence of the paragraph that supports the first one.

This is the first sentence of the paragraph which continues the idea from the second one and supports

the idea of the first one.

So you see it.

There also has to be the connection between the sentences, the sentence, no free follows logically

from the sentence number two and also supports sentence number one.

This is the fourth sentence of the paragraph which continues the idea from the first one and support

the idea of the first one.

OK, so again, we have transitions.

We have logical connections between sentences, but also every sentence supports the first sentence.

All right, let's move to paragraph number two.

And here we had the very same thing.

The first sentence of this paragraph is the most important sentence of this paragraph, which has now

three goals.

Number one, it supports the thesis again.

So this sentence supports this sentence.

OK, number two, it is logically related to the previous paragraph by a transition.

So it's very important that we have a transition in this sentence.

For example, we can say second right in the first paragraph, beginning of the transition first, we

can say second so that this paragraph logically follows the first paragraph.

Or we can, for example, say on the other hand or we can say consequently something like that.

So we use a translation which states the logical connection between paragraph number one.

Paragraph number two, the goal number free of this sentence is it combines everything that will be

said later in the paragraph.

So, again, this is kind of a title, the main idea of all the examples and details which will follow

in this paragraph, then we have pretty much the same thing which we had in paragraph number one.

This is a second sentence of the paragraph that supports the first one.

This is the third sentence of the paragraph which continues the idea from the second one and supports

the idea of the first one.

This is the first sentence of the paragraph which continues the idea from the third one and supports

the idea of the first one.

So all the sentences within the paragraph are connected very closely.

They follow each other and then all of them support the first sentence of this part of the topic sentence,

this bold sentence of this paragraph.

Number two.

Now we come to the conclusion finally and here again, the first sentence is the most important sentence

of the conclusion.

This is the first sentence of the conclusion, which has two goals.

Number one, it better.

Raises the main idea, which is a fezzes from the last sentence of the introduction.

So in the conclusion, to paraphrase this last sentence, paraphrased the thesis, OK, so here we have

the paraphrase of the feces.

And no, to paraphrase is the main arguments, which means the first sentences of the paragraphs.

So in this sentence were paraphrased, all the important sentences were paraphrased of feces and then

a paraphrase all this topic sentences topic.

Sentence number one.

Topic sentence number two.

OK, so here a paraphrase a thesis and the main arguments, which were of course in the first sentence

is all the paragraphs.

OK, so after we did this very important job, we then add some extra sentences to the conclusion this

is the second sentence of the conclusion, which adds something insignificant.

This is the first sentence of the conclusion, which adds something else insignificant and it completes

the entire text.

So two more sentences are not that important.

It's just the additional sentences so that we can close our text.

OK, so this is a structure of a coherent text.

And in every writing that you do for the Teufel test and ideally for any English writing whatsoever,

you should use this structure.

Let's have a look at another thing which adds coherence to our text.

It is transitions so that transitions are those words which help us connect the sentences with each

other.

For example, we have this two sentences in my physics class.

We did lots of experiments that helped clarify scientific principles.

I understood those principles better by doing those experiments.

So here it is better for us to use a transition which can actually help us to make these two sentences

shorter and also make it better connected.

Let's have a look at this example.

In my physics class, we did lots of experiments that helped clarify scientific principles.

As a result, I understand those principles better.

So in this case, our sentences are shorter and also they are well connected in order for you to practice

the transitions.

We have a lot of exercises in the resources.

We have a list of transitions which you can learn, and then we have the exercises which can help you

practice the transitions.

Using transitions is crucial for your writing score.

So go ahead and do those exercises and learn or revise those transitions because it's very important

for you to know them.

Another thing which can help you with your cohesion is adding cohesion in your sentences by changing

the nouns to the pronouns so that you don't have to repeat a noun over and over again, but you can

just replace it with a pronoun.

This makes your text coherent because it actually connects the sentences to each other.

Let's have a look.

I have always wanted to see Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park.

Besides the Old Faithful Geyser, vast wilderness areas can be found in Yellowstone National Park.

Interesting wildlife inhabits the vast wilderness areas.

The interesting wildlife found in Yellowstone National Park includes besoin moose, elk and bears.

So we see here that some of the words are repeated several times.

We see that old faithful geyser, which is green, is repeated twice.

Yellowstone National Park, which are marked yellow because it's Yellowstone, is repeated three times

interest.

Interesting wildlife is repeated two times and then vast wilderness areas is repeated twice.

So of course, we want to avoid this repetition and we do so by replacing these words with pronouns.

So let's have a look.

We already have Old Faithful Geyser, so instead of repeating it, we're just going to ride these geyser

besides this geyser.

Sounds perfect.

OK, so we already have Yellowstone National Park.

So here, instead of repeating it, we're going to right there.

Besides this geyser, vast wilderness areas can be found there.

Now, we already have lost wilderness areas.

They were here.

So that's why replace it with these areas.

Interesting wildlife inhabits these areas.

Now, we already have interesting wildlife here, so we need to replace it here by wild animals.

Wild animals found in Yellowstone National Park includes bees and moose out and bears.

Now here, the Yellowstone National Park is repeated again and we want to replace it with the park wild

animals found in the park because we already know what park we're talking about includes bees and moose,

elk and bears.

So now this text is coherent.

We added a.

A lot of cohesion to it by replacing the words with pronouns.

So this is how you work on cohesion of your text.

You make sure that the text is well developed by putting the thesis statement where it should be and

putting the topic sentences where it should be.

And also by writing a conclusion which refreezes the thesis statement and the topic sentences.

You also use transitions with your text and you can find the list of transitions as well as the exercises

in the resources to this video.

Also, you add cohesion by replacing the nouns with the pronouns.

This makes your sentences connected and shorter.

And of course in the resources we have exercises which can help you to practice all of these things

and improve the overall cohesion of your writing.

So go ahead, do these exercises as well and they will see you on the next video where we will finally

go to discussing writing number one.
