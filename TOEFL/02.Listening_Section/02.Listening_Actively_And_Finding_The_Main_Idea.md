### 02.Listening_Actively_And_Finding_The_Main_Idea

On the test day, you will have something like this:

We need to listen to the complete passage.Our goal is not to understand everything.
Our goal is to answer the questions correctly.

Best way to do that is to imagine yourself as a teacher: `How am i going to explain this paragraph to a ten-year-old?`

Take a pause and do that.

When you do the above , you go to the questions with experience.

### 03. Importance of main idea
If you remember, in your Quick Guide, there are 6 passages in the listening section,4 of them are lectures and 2 are conversations. 
So we're just going to talk about the 2 conversation passages. So in your conversation passages the very first question is either going to be 
`gist-content` or `gist-purpose`.

- gist-content : 

**Question Type1:**
Basically this one talks about the purpose and "What is the problem the student is having?" 
So the student's problem is the main idea. Which we need to find

**Question Type2:**
Sometimes they say the problem outright:

- gist-purpose

### 04. Main idea in lectures
After listening short part of the audio passage, you should be able to explain it to a ten-year-old clearly and simply.
Sometimes, `lecturer` might start with a topic and totally change the topic.
We should listen the whole lecture carefully and be able to put it in your own words.
