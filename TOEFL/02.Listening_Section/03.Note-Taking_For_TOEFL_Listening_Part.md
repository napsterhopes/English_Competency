## Note taking for TOEFL Listening Part

Taking notes is important to rely while answering questions related to the long audio that you have listened to.

### 1. Write down only nouns,verbs, and adjectives. Note down `content words` (words that contain significance, such as people or places,actions,and descriptions).
- There are `function words` (words like propositions,articles,auxiliary verbs(have), and modals(could)).

Prepositions: `in`,`on`,`under`
Articles: `A`,`An`,`The`

We need not take notes of `function words` only `content words`.

- Example : `Insomnia,a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep,is the most common of the sleep disorders`

Notes: `insomnia common sleep disorder`

### 2. Write down consonants, not vowels
- Vowels : `a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`
- Consonants : every other letter than vowel

This is only just to save time. Notice that i have omitted vowels and its a shorthand note taking technique.

### 3. Note down core words

### 4. Guiding questions

1. What is the student's problem?
2. Why does the student go to see the ..?
3. What are the possible solutions to the problem?

When listening to a conversation, try to find:
- the problem
- the possible solutions
- the steps to solve the problem
