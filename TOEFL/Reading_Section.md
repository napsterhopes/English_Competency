### Reading Section

The very first part of the TOEFL exam is the reading section. 
In the reading, you will find three academic passages(700 words), each followed 10 questions.
However, when you register for the TOEFL, you will be asked about
your field of study. Expect to have topics that are somewhat related to your major. Possible academic
topics include, architecture, biology, astronomy, physics, anthropology, American history, meteorology, etc.
