#### Speaking section

It's a little bit of a challenge. 
Napoleon Hill once said `Education comes from within; you get it by struggle, effort, and thoughts.`

For the Speaking section you really have to practice on your own to get good at this, and especially to work with a teacher.

One thing about the speaking is that you're gonna have to perform in a noisy room. 
And that's gonna be a challenge.
And what I mean by noisy is that after `Listening` section is a 10-minute break. When you come back from your 10-minute break, you will go to the same room, but people will be speaking and they'll be doing the same TOEFL speaking questions that you have to do as well. So you're gonna have to get used to speaking in a noisy room,
and that's gonna be a little bit of a challenge. 

But that's just one of the many things we're gonna talk about together to get you feeling more comfortable and confident on test day. 
By the end of this section you will be able to :

- Develop a growth mindset 
- Understand the basics of the TOEFL Speaking grading criteria
- learn the structure of all 6 questions
- Utilize a templated response for each question
- Organize your responses to align with time restrictions
- Score your own responses and identify weaknesses 
- Listen to and shadow responses by native speakers

And we're going to do all this in about 80 minutes.
